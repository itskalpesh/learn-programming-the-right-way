# 📘 Day 03 — Input & Output
Week 01: Fundamentals

⏱ Time: 2–3 Hours  
🎯 Focus: Make Python programs interactive (real programming starts)

## 🧠 Why Input & Output Matters

If a program cannot take input, it is NOT useful.

Hardcoded values = toy programs  
User input = real programs

Every real program follows this flow:

Input → Processing → Output

---

## ❓ What is Input?

Input means **taking data from the user** while the program is running.

In Python:
- `input()` → takes input as string
- `int()` / `float()` → convert input

---

## ❓ What is Output?

Output means **showing result to the user**.

In Python:
- `print()` → displays output

---

## 🔁 Core Programming Logic (VERY IMPORTANT)

Input → Store in variable → Process → Output

This logic will NEVER change  
Only syntax changes between languages

---

## 🛠 Practice 1 — Basic Input & Output

```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello", name)
```
What happens:
- Program pauses
- User types input
- Program responds


### Task: Simple Calculator (Addition)
Steps:
1. Take numbers as input & store in variables
2. Add them
3. Print the result
   
👉 If you know C or Java, try it there.
Otherwise, Python is enough.
