# 📘 Day 02 — Variables & Data Types  
**Week 01: Fundamentals**

⏱ Time: 2–3 Hours  
🎯 Focus: Store data correctly and understand how programs remember information

---

## ❓ What is a Variable?

A variable is a **container that stores data** in memory.

You can think of it as:
- A box with a name
- The box holds a value
- The value can change

Example (real life):
- Name = "Kalpesh"
- Age = 20

---

## 🧠 Why Variables Matter

Without variables:
- Programs cannot remember data
- No calculations are possible
- No logic can be applied

💡 Every program uses variables — from calculators to Instagram.

---

## 🧩 Variable Naming Rules (Universal Logic)

Most languages follow these rules:

✅ Must start with a letter or underscore  
✅ Can contain letters, numbers, underscore  
❌ Cannot start with a number  
❌ No spaces allowed  
❌ No reserved keywords  

Good examples:
- `age`
- `total_marks`
- `_count`

Bad examples:
- `1value`
- `total marks`
- `int`

## 🧪 What are Data Types?

Data types define **what kind of data** a variable can store.

Common data types:

| Data Type | Example | Meaning |
|---------|---------|--------|
| int | 10 | Whole numbers |
| float | 3.14 | Decimal numbers |
| char | 'A' | Single character |
| string | "Hello" | Text |
| boolean | true / false | Yes / No |

## 🔍 Data Types in Different Languages

### Python
```python
age = 20          # int
price = 99.99    # float
name = "Kalpesh" # string
is_student = True # boolean
```

### C
```c
int age = 20;
float price = 99.99;
char grade = 'A';
```
### Java
```java
int age = 20;
float price = 99.99f;
String name = "Kalpesh";
boolean isStudent = true;
```
## 🛠 Practice (MANDATORY)
### Task: Simple Calculator (Addition)
Steps:
1. Store two numbers in variables
2. Add them
3. Print the result
   
👉 If you know C or Java, try it there.
Otherwise, Python is enough.
